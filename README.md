## HiðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Alison,  graduate of Gordon College with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Iâ€™m proficient in C++ and have expanded my expertise into Data Science and Machine Learning. Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning, whether exploring new topics or deepening foundational knowledge.

- Completed my Senior Project: a language learning app built with Flutter and Dart, developed in collaboration with Pioneer Bible Translators to support literacy in a minority language.

-  Completed the Break Through Tech AI program as a Studio Fellow, where my team worked with Cadence to develop a Machine Learning-based Root Cause Analysis tool using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

-  Gained hands-on experience in AI/ML, starting with the Break Through Tech program in April â€” my entry point into Data Science.
