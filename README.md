## HiðŸ‘‹

Hello, Iâ€™m Alison, a Senior at Gordon College working toward a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Iâ€™m proficient in C++ and am currently broadening my expertise in Data Science. Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning, both by exploring new areas and reinforcing foundational knowledge gained throughout my college experience.

- I am currently working on my Senior Project at Gordon College, developing a Language learning application. For this project, I leverage Flutter and Dart on VScode to develop the entire application.
- I am also currently working on a project as an AI studio fellow at BreakThroughTech AI. I am currently working on a Machine Learning Root Cause Analysis for Cadence, the company I was matched with. This team project leverages Google Colab as well as Python and ML packages (sci-kit learn, Pandas, numpy) to learn for a dataset and determine if the type of bug (Null Dereference or Memory Leak)

- I am currently learning about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I started the BreakThroughTech AI program in April, which was my first experience with Data Science.
 
- Fun fact: I love painting and sketching in my free time.
